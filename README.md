# odin-recipes
This is my first project. Following the guide on www.theodinproject.com.
I have learnt to create a simple html file, use VSCODE to make the boilerplate from the shortcut. 
I have learnt to make title for the file, create headings, paragraphics, adding images and alt text. And I've also learnt to turn character bold or italic.
